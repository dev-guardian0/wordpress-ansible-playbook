# database import paths.  Include the path to your sql import if you want to import.
# by default these are not defined. Uncomment and fill with the the correct path to your local import file that will
# be copied over to the source.

# search_replace_path is the path to the WordPress installation where the db was exported from.  It will be replaced
# with the path for the domain the db is being imported to.

# search_replace_domain is the domain in the db file for the old WordPress installation that will get replaced with the
# domain for the new installation. If the db import is already correct for the domain either don't set the variable or
# have it as the same as what is defined for the domain on the host.  Include the scheme (https:// or http://)

# ssl is for whether the new domain should be ssl or not (https:// or http://).  It will depend on whether you've setup
# the new site with lets encrypt cert or not (defualt true).

# db_prefix is for if the table you are importing is using an non-standard db prefix.
